# VGG-16 in TensorFlow (Experimantel)

[ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) is a common academic data set in machine
learning for training an image recognition system. Code in this directory
demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a type of convolutional
neural network (CNN) on this academic data set.
In particular, this is a first draft using and training VGG-16 model.
It is a (for now) mostly of copy of Inception V3 folder and its slim use,
building a VGG-16 model using Slim (instead of Inception V3).

The usage is identical to Inception V3 usage (see README of Inception V3).
